# Stack Overflow Python and R Question Analysis

## Project Overview
In today's era, as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) become more prevalent, a growing number of individuals are venturing into the fields of Data Analysis and Data Science. Among the most popular languages used in these fields are Python and R, which serve various purposes such as data cleaning, visualization, model building, analysis, and statistical computation.

Despite the increasing demand for expertise in these languages, people choose different learning paths. Some acquire knowledge through university coursework, others through online short courses, and many through self-study. Regardless of the learning mode, practitioners often encounter doubts and questions, which they seek to resolve through public communities. One prominent platform for addressing programming-related queries is Stack Overflow.

Stack Overflow hosts a vast repository of user-generated content that reflects the real-world challenges and solutions encountered by practitioners. By analyzing the questions related to Python and R on Stack Overflow, we can gain valuable insights into common issues, emerging trends, and areas of interest within the community. This analysis helps to understand whether there's a growing preference for one language over the other or if both languages exhibit similar trends over time.

## Dataset
The dataset utilized in this analysis includes the total number of questions asked on the Stack Overflow website specifically related to Python and R. The dataset consists of 185 observations with monthly intervals from September 2008 to February 2024. To ensure consistency in our analysis, we focused on the time series data from January 2009 to February 2024, with a frequency of 12 months.

The original dataset contains 21 columns, including the date column and the total count of questions in 20 different programming languages. For our analysis, we extracted three key columns: Month, Python, and R.

## Analysis Summary
This report provides a comprehensive summary of the analysis performed on the total number of questions related to Python and R on Stack Overflow. The key steps in our analysis include:

* **Descriptive Analysis:** We conducted an initial descriptive analysis of the data for both Python and R to understand the distribution and trends.
* **Time Series Transformation:** Based on the findings from the descriptive analysis, we applied necessary transformations to the time series data to achieve stationarity. The stationarity of the data was validated using Unit-root tests.
* **ARIMA Modeling:** Once the data was stationary, we applied Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models to identify potential models based on the order of (p, d, q) in the model and estimated the parameters.
* **Model Evaluation:** After finalizing the best model, we evaluated its performance through diagnostic checks on the residuals.
* **Forecasting:** Finally, we forecasted the total number of questions related to Python and R for the next 10 months using the identified best model.

## Conclusion
This analysis sheds light on the trends in the usage of Python and R within the Stack Overflow community, offering insights that can guide both learners and practitioners in understanding the evolving landscape of programming languages in data science.
